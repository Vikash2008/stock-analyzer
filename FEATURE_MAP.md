| **API routing** | — | `backend/main.py` |
| **Buckets & Labels (user-defined classification)** | `frontend/src/utils/buckets.ts` (also `getLabelCurrency`/`setLabelCurrency`, 2026-07-04), `frontend/src/components/ManageBucketsModal.tsx` (collapsible sections, collapsed by default on open; non-deletable "Broker Portfolios" section moved to the end, 2026-07-04), `frontend/src/hooks/useSetTags.ts` | `backend/routers/add_txn.py` (`set_tags` endpoint), `src/portfolio.py`/`src/price_fetcher.py` (`tags`/`quote_type` fields) |
| **Manage Portfolio menu (Add/Delete/Copy landing)** | `frontend/src/components/ManagePortfolioModal.tsx` | — |
| **Delete Holding modal** | `frontend/src/components/DeleteHoldingModal.tsx` (2026-07-04: Bucket/Label scope is ALWAYS an untag now — the old "Show txn" real-delete escape hatch from a Label view was removed; those rows are read-only detail) | `backend/routers/add_txn.py` (`delete-holding` endpoint) |

| **Dividends tab** | REWORKED 2026-07-04 — `frontend/src/hooks/useDividends.ts`'s `useDividendEvents`/`refreshDividendEvents` (one shared module-level store, `useSyncExternalStore`, no auto-fetch, batches of 10 with priority-symbols-first) is the single fetch pipeline, replacing the old dual `useDividends`+`useDividendsBatched`; `frontend/src/utils/dividends.ts`'s `computeDividendsForScope()` (TS port of the old backend aggregation) turns the shared raw events into portfolio/segment/bucket-scoped totals client-side — same pattern `HoldingsPage.tsx`'s `xirrMap` already used; `frontend/src/components/DividendsTab.tsx` consumes both, no longer fetches itself; `frontend/src/api/dividends.ts` (`fetchDividendEvents`, raw per-symbol response types) | `backend/routers/dividends.py` — `GET /api/dividends?symbols=...` only, no `portfolio` param, no result cache; returns raw per-symbol events only. **Fix (2026-07-04)**: `HoldingsPage.tsx`'s `allDividendSymbols`/`divScopePortfolios` now derive from `data.transactions` (every symbol/portfolio ever traded), not `data.holdings` (open positions only) — a fully-sold symbol or a portfolio with zero open positions left was silently excluded before. `DividendsTab.tsx` header no longer has a Refresh button (redundant with Settings popover); just shows "Updated HH:MM" top-right. |
| **FX / currency gains tab** | `frontend/src/components/FxGainsTab.tsx` | — |
| **Portfolio aggregate chart (Holdings + Txn page, unified 2026-07-03, CSV-privacy-fixed same day, bucket/label scoping fixed 2026-07-05)** | `frontend/src/hooks/useBackendPortfolioHistory.ts` — used by BOTH `HoldingsPage.tsx` (whole-portfolio/bucket-label, no `symbol` param) AND `TransactionsPage.tsx` (scoped via `symbol` param); now sends `csvContent` (POST) like `usePortfolio.ts` does, keys its cache/query by `csvHash`, and refetches in step with the main portfolio bundle's refresh instead of its own timer; now also takes `bucket`/`label` params, passed by `HoldingsPage.tsx` for Bucket/Label views | `backend/routers/portfolio_history.py` — GET (demo) + POST (real CSV) /api/portfolio-history?currency=&portfolio=&segment=&symbol=&bucket=&label=; result-cache key now `csvHash:currency:portfolio:segment:symbol:bucket:label` (was missing csvHash — cross-user collision risk); raw prices come from shared `backend/price_store.py`, not a private cache; `usePortfolioHistory.ts` now ONLY provides symbolPriceMap (start=2022-01-01, lsKey `${sym}:3y`), no aggregate math left client-side. **2026-07-05 fix**: added `bucket`/`label` filter (Python port of `resolveLabel()`) — Bucket/Label Charts-tab views previously had no way to scope this endpoint at all and silently got the full portfolio total |

## Caching & Storage Layer (check here first for "stale/short/wrong data" bugs)

| Layer | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend shared KV cache | `frontend/src/utils/idbStore.ts` | Single IndexedDB store backing `hist:*`, `qs:*`, `dividends:events:v1` (2026-07-04, replaces the old per-portfolio `dividends:cache:*`/`dividends:cache:v2:*` keys — one flat key holding every symbol's raw dividend events, no portfolio dimension), `gemini:*` keys. Hydrates into an in-memory `Map` once at boot (`idbReady`, awaited in `main.tsx`). All reads after boot are synchronous against the Map — a value only shows up post-boot if `idbSet` was called, not just written to IndexedDB directly. |
| Chart history cache (frontend) | `frontend/src/hooks/useHistory.ts` (`lsGet`/`lsSet`, prefix `hist:`) | Sends the last cached date as `since` to request a delta instead of full history. `mergeHistory()` only merges if the backend response carries `partial_since` — otherwise it **replaces** the cache. A missing `partial_since` flag on a real delta response is exactly what caused the 2026-06-19 flat-line/dot chart bug. |
| Chart history cache (backend, resident) | `backend/price_store.py` (shared, was `history.py`'s private `_series_cache` until 2026-07-03) | No longer trimmed — unified with `portfolio_history.py`'s price fetch onto one full-history store (capped at 150 symbols instead of a date-window trim). Persisted to disk at `data/.price_store.pkl`, but disk is ephemeral across Oracle VM deploys — a fresh deploy starts with an empty resident cache. The frontend's IndexedDB is still the long-term store for deep history from this user's own device. |
| Live price/FX cache (backend, disk) | `src/cache.py` (prices/prev_closes/fx layers, `data/.cache.pkl`) | TTL 2 min (2026-07-02, was 30 min). Kept warm independent of requests by `backend/price_refresh.py`'s background loop (every 2 min) — a real request almost always reads already-fresh cache instead of waiting on a live yfinance call. 2026-07-03: loop now merges fresh prices over the last-known-good cache (`Cache.get_stale()`) instead of replacing wholesale, so a partial/timed-out fetch can't wipe prices for symbols it missed. |
| Uploaded-CSV FIFO cache (backend, RAM-only) | `src/cache.py` (`_RAM_FIFO` dict) | 2026-07-02 privacy fix: real portfolio holdings/txns for an uploaded CSV live only in process RAM (keyed by CSV content hash, capped at 5 most recent), never written to `data/.cache.pkl`. Only the bundled demo file's FIFO entry is still disk-cached. Lost on every backend restart — a cache miss just costs one recompute from the browser's own `localStorage` CSV copy. |
| PWA / service worker | `frontend/vite.config.ts` (`VitePWA` / workbox) | Precaches only static build assets (`js/css/html/svg/png/ico`) — **no `runtimeCaching` for `/api/*`**, so API responses are never served from the service worker cache. Rule out SW caching quickly by checking this file has no `runtimeCaching` block before suspecting it. |
| Browser HTTP cache | n/a — check response headers | `backend/routers/history.py` doesn't set explicit `Cache-Control`; Cloudflare in front of Render shows `cf-cache-status` header (`DYNAMIC` = not edge-cached). Use `curl -D -` against the live Render URL to check headers/cache status directly without needing the user's browser. |
| Other localStorage (not yet migrated) | grep `localStorage` directly if a key isn't one of the `idbStore.ts` prefixes above | Most caches moved to IndexedDB in the OOM fix (session 139) — if investigating a cache bug, confirm which store (localStorage vs IndexedDB) the key actually lives in before assuming. |
| Benchmark index history cache | `frontend/src/hooks/useBenchmarkXirr.ts` (`bench:` prefix in idbStore) | Added session 150 — previously had zero persistence (full re-fetch from 2015 on every reload). Now mirrors the Charts/Dividends pattern: IndexedDB-backed, incremental `since`/`partial_since` fetch, real `lastFetchedAt` exposed instead of `new Date()`. |
| Aggregate chart cache (frontend) | `frontend/src/hooks/useBackendPortfolioHistory.ts` (`portfolioHist:` prefix in idbStore) | Added 2026-07-03 — previously had ZERO on-device persistence (in-memory React Query cache only), so closing the app always lost it. Now paints instantly on reopen like the other charts; 30-min staleTime (raised from 5 min 2026-07-04, matches backend's `_CACHE_TTL` and market_hours' own 30-min is_stale gate) backed by a real elapsed-time-poll auto-refresh (was staleTime-only before, never actually ticked while the page sat open). Per-symbol history feeding XIRR/benchmarking (`usePortfolioHistory.ts`'s `OPEN_REFRESH_MS`) also raised to 30 min same day; `PriceChart.tsx`'s own fetch stays at 2 min (`useHistory.ts`'s `REFRESH_MS`, unchanged) since it's the closest thing to a live quote. |
| Aggregate chart raw price cache (backend, disk) | Same shared `backend/price_store.py` as the row above (was its own separate `_price_cache`/`data/.portfolio_hist_cache.pkl` until 2026-07-03, now one store for both chart types) | Makes each 5-min recompute incremental instead of a full multi-year `yf.download()`. Capped at 400 symbols (raised from 150 on 2026-07-03 — was smaller than a single portfolio's own symbol count, causing eviction mid-request and wrong aggregate totals); the outer computed-*result* cache (`_cache` in portfolio_history.py) still has no eviction cap, only a 5-min TTL — see ARCHITECTURE.md Pending. |
| Installed PWA storage (Android) | n/a | On Android, an installed PWA (home-screen icon / WebAPK) has storage separate from Chrome's own "Site settings → Clear site data." Must clear via **Android Settings → Apps → [app name] → Storage & cache → Clear storage** instead. Confirmed 2026-06-19: chart-truncation bug looked unfixed on phone after clearing Chrome site storage, resolved once app-level storage was cleared. |

## Hot-Spot Line Anchors (oversized files)

## Usage Rule

```
User prompt: "UI fix / Deep Research / Sources button overlaps model name"
→ Look up "Deep Research cards" → frontend/src/components/ReportTab.tsx
→ Read that file → make change. Done. No exploration.

User prompt: "Working on: Quick Stats for next few changes"  
→ Cache: ReportTab.tsx + quickstats.py in session context
→ All follow-up Quick Stats prompts: go directly to these files, no re-read
→ Evict only when user says "Quick Stats done" or "moving on"
```
